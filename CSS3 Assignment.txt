Q1)	Why css selector used in html?
Ans-CSS selectors are used in HTML to target and style specific elements or groups of elements on a webpage. They provide a way to apply styles selectively, allowing developers to control the presentation and layout of HTML content. Here are some key reasons why CSS selectors are used in HTML:
1. Targeting Elements:
* CSS selectors allow developers to target specific HTML elements or groups of elements. This enables them to apply styles only to the elements they want to modify, leaving other elements unaffected.
2. Styling Consistency:
* CSS selectors help maintain consistency in styling across a website. By applying styles to specific elements or classes, developers can ensure that similar elements throughout the site share a consistent look and feel.
3. Responsive Design:
* CSS selectors are crucial for creating responsive designs. With media queries and specific selectors, developers can apply different styles based on the screen size or device, ensuring a better user experience on various platforms.

Q)How do you used external fonts and apply them?
ANS-To use external fonts and apply them to your web page, you can make use of the @font-face rule in CSS. This rule allows you to define custom fonts and make them available for use on your website. Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Find a Font:
* Choose the font you want to use on your website. There are various websites that offer free and paid fonts, such as Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) and Adobe Fonts (https://fonts.adobe.com/).
2. Include the Font in Your HTML:
* Add a <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document to include the font from an external source. For example, to include a font from Google Fonts:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>External Fonts</title>
    <!-- Include the font from Google Fonts -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700&display=swap">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
Define the Font in Your CSS:
* In your CSS file, use the @font-face rule to define the font-family and specify the source of the font file. You need to provide the font in various formats (e.g., WOFF, WOFF2) to ensure compatibility with different browsers.
/* Define the font using @font-face */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Roboto';
    src: url('path-to-font/Roboto-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Modern Browsers */
         url('path-to-font/Roboto-Regular.woff') format('woff'); /* Legacy Browsers */
    font-weight: 400; /* Specify the font weight */
    font-style: normal; /* Specify the font style */
}

/* Apply the font to specific elements */
body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700; /* Using a different weight for headers */
}
