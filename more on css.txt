/* Example: Transition for all properties */
transition-property: all;

/* Example: Transition for specific properties */
transition-property: width, color, opacity;
Transition Timing Function (transition-timing-function):
* Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect. It defines how intermediate values are calculated.

/* Example: Ease-in-out timing function */
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;

/* Example: Linear timing function */
transition-timing-function: linear;
Transition Delay (transition-delay):
* Specifies the delay before the transition effect starts. It is expressed in seconds (s) or milliseconds 
/* Example: Delay the transition by 0.2 seconds */
transition-delay: 0.2s;
