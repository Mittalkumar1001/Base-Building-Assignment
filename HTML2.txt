Q1)Explain the table and its properties?
ANS- In HTML, the <table> element is used to create tables, which are a way to organize and display data in a structured grid format. Tables consist of rows (<tr>), which contain cells (<td>) or header cells (<th>). Here's an overview of the basic structure and properties of HTML tables:
1. <table>:
* The main container for the entire table.
2. <thead>:
* The table head section contains one or more <tr> elements that represent the header row(s) of the table.
3. <tr>:
* The table row element defines a row of cells in the table.
4. <th>:
* The table header cell element defines a header cell within a <tr>. Text within <th> is usually bold and centered by default.
5. <tbody>:
* The table body section contains one or more <tr> elements that represent the data rows of the table.
Q2)Explain all media element and how they work?
ANS- In HTML, the <audio> and <video> elements are used to embed media content, such as audio and video files, into a web page. These elements provide a native way to include multimedia content without the need for third-party plugins. Let's explore the <audio> and <video> elements and how they work.
<audio> Element:
The <audio> element is used to embed audio content into a web page. Here is a basic example:
htmlCopy code
<audio controls> <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3"> Your browser does not support the audio tag. </audio> 
* The controls attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player.
* The <source> element inside <audio> is used to specify the audio file source and its type. Multiple <source> elements can be used to provide alternative file formats for broader browser compatibility.
<video> Element:
The <video> element is used to embed video content into a web page. Here is a basic example:
htmlCopy code
<video width="640" height="360" controls> <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> 
* The width and height attributes set the dimensions of the video player.
* The controls attribute adds playback controls to the video player.
* Like <audio>, the <video> element can have multiple <source> elements for different video formats.
Common Attributes for Both <audio> and <video> Elements:
* autoplay: Automatically starts playback when the page loads.
htmlCopy code
<audio autoplay controls> <!-- Audio source(s) --> </audio> 
* loop: Causes the media to play in a loop.
htmlCopy code
<video loop controls> <!-- Video source(s) --> </video>
Q3)What is get and post in form?
ANS- In HTML, the GET and POST methods are two common HTTP methods used when submitting forms. These methods define how the data entered into a form is sent to the server for processing.
GET Method:
* Usage: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.
* Data in URL: The form data is appended to the URL as query parameters. This makes it visible in the browser's address bar.
* Length Limitation: There is a limitation on the amount of data that can be sent. URLs have a maximum length, and longer data might be truncated.
* Caching: Form submissions using GET can be cached by the browser, and the data may be saved in the browser's history.
Example:
htmlCopy code
<form action="/submit" method="GET"> <label for="username">Username:</label> <input type="text" id="username" name="username"> <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form> 
When the form is submitted, the URL might look like: http://example.com/submit?username=johndoe
POST Method:
* Usage: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
* Data in Request Body: The form data is sent in the request body, not in the URL. This makes it more secure and suitable for sensitive or large amounts of data.
* Length Limitation: There is generally no limitation on the amount of data that can be sent using POST.
* Security: POST is considered more secure for sensitive data, as the data is not visible in the URL.
